Hey, I am Christian Beneke, a Site Reliability Engineer currently working in Berlin.

I am passionate about [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), running small to medium scale clusters in production since 2018 and privately a little bit longer. I am coming from an IT Operations background and studied Mathematics in Berlin. Since I work at [TradeRepublic](https://traderepublic.com/de-de) I am also getting more and more interested in the financial world.

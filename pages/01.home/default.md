Thanks for visiting my blog. If you're interested in IT stuff like linux, dedicated root servers, kubernetes and the troubles you get from any of them, you're welcome to read my upcoming blog-posts. If not, feel free to look around anyway!

I will only write new blog-posts, whenever I feel the urge to share some knowledge. Thus the posts may be irregulary, but I try to keep the quality up.

And now I'm sitting here in front of my laptop thinking about what to write as first post on my new blog. You could say that shouldn't be too hard, but who doesn't get a chill when writing on the first page of a new notepad?

# What to write about?
That is actually the question bothering me since ... yeah, inbetween the time I finished setting up this board and the moment I started writing this actual post. I easily wrote down some notes, how I wanted to fire up this special very first blogentry:

It shall have something to do with what I'm planning to publish later on this blog - it doesn't
It shall be about an topic I'm very well known to and/or just finished working on - it isn't
It shall not be an general introduction to or talk about this blog - it is
As you can see, I really stuck by the notes.

# The future
This blog will be about IT releated topics like the server this blog runs on and the very releated services running on its virtual machines. Also is may contain posts about interesting and/or horrifying news from the information technologies sector.
I hope you feel encouraged to read further posts on my blog, and wish you a nice whatever time it is currently at yours!
